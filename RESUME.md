## About Me

My name is Maeve and I am a Sophomore at Heritage High School. I am interested in the world of computer science, specifically data science and machine learning. In my free time, I like to draw and play video games!



### Strengths

I am able to collaborate with my peers to develop new ideas or solve complex issues. I can adapt quickly within a situation using problem solving and communication skills.   

### Goals

I am working on personal projects, including ML projects and game design. 

## EPIC Experience

### Pi's and Python
* Write a summary of what you learned in this course.  
* Be sure to incorporate your use of professional workforce readiness skills in addition to the content you learned.

### Workforce Readiness

Through my first semester at EPIC, I learned the value of developing problem solving skills and communication. Not only did skills help me develop a stronger foundation in computer science, but they are also applicable to other schoolwork and job-related areas. 

### Professional Experiences
I attended SC23 and participated in a tour at Google Boulder.

## Projects: 
-  Morse Code - https://github.com/maevegillies/Morse-Code
Morse Code was a project designed to help our class learn about proper documentation. Using the Raspberry Pi and Obsidian, I wrote code that would turn an LED on and off. From this, I developed proper research and documentation practices that I applied to later projects. 

- Final Project - https://github.com/maevegillies/Python-S1-Final-Project
My final project was an extreme alarm clock. Its purpose was to create something inventive without being hard to understand, which I achieved only using the Pi, a speaker, and an LCD.
